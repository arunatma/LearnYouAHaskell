-- Some Other Points::
-- On a GHC console
--  :l first        Loads the script "first.hs" (.hs can be omitted)
--  :l first.hs     This too is just fine
--  :r              Loads the active script, as of now "first.hs" 
--  :reload         Same as above
--  :t              Gets the type of the expression  
--                  Integer, [Integer], Bool, Char, [Char] etc
